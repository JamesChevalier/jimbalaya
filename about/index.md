## About

Hey I'm [Jimbalaya](http://twitter.com/JamesChevalier). This site hosts all my audio work. Here's a list of what you'll find...

*   [Creations][3] – Most of my work; mosaics of sound
*   [Found Sounds][4] – Quick posts of recordings made while I'm out & about; expect short descriptions and a link to download the recording
*   [Introductions][5] – Occasionally I'll put together a short intro for someone else's mix
*   [Mixes][6] – I like to hit either 30 or 60 minutes of continuous music along with some various samples sprinkled throughout
*   [Podcast][7] – Now Defunct; one episode every Monday ... Hoping for a triumphant return; available [on iTunes][8]
*   [Scribbles][9] – Short/Quickly put together edits; a bit like scribbles on a page
*   [Thoughts][10] – Announcements, or blogish entries; we'll see what happens here

Whenever I can, I point artist, album, and song links to iTunes. These are affiliate links, and I get a percentage of the sale price if you buy the songs or albums through my links.
