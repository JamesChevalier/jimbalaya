Hey, welcome to the new site! I apologize ahead of time for any broken links, etc. Please [let me know][2] if you have any trouble with anything...

  [2]: contact "Contact"

I moved over to [WordPress][3] from [Joomla][4] because it's so much simpler & much nicer to look at (I think). There are also new Podcast URLs – [Podcast RSS Link][5] or [Podcast iTunes Link][6]. Anyway, this spot is for my audio work not the geek stuff – if you want the geek stuff, [find me elsewhere][7].

In addition to the changes, I do hope to get a new piece of action going – Found Sounds.  Those posts will be really short, just like my [Scribbles][8] – just a link to the audio with a short description of where it came from.  We'll see how that goes...
