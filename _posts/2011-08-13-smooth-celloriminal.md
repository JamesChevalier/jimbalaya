I do a lot of audio editing for [Artistic Dance Conservatory][2] - everything from quick edits to detailed mashups – and this last project was a lot of fun.  They wanted [Michael Jackson][3]‘s [Smooth Criminal][4] mashed up with [2Cellos][5]‘ version of [the same song][6], and it had to be a minute long.

One minute isn't a whole lot of time to work with... It took a lot of work to edit the mashup down into what was needed for the choreography, without missing out on the song itself.  I ended up also using an a capella copy of Smooth Criminal alongside the 2Cello music – it was a lot of fun.

Since I was enjoying the mix so much, I decided to continue working on it after submitting the copy that was requested... I ended up with a two and a half minute mashup: Smooth Celloriminal.
