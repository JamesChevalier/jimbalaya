It looks like I skipped an earlier [King Megatrip][2] mix. This time he used my edit ‘Aquitar Intro (Jim Sitting On A Park Bench)' in his mix ‘The Van Bowlski Brothers'. It's the fourth mix in the Roofers vs Records Trilogy. Hip Hop, Classic Rock and Punk stuff all mashed together with a virtual ton of spoken word samples (most of which is completely profane and offensive).

ok – here it is.... the 4th mix in the ‘roofers vs records' trilogy(?!)

another one of those mixes I do for the kids I work with... all over the map. Hip Hop, Classic Rock and Punk stuff all mashed together with a virtual ton of spoken word samples (most of which is completely profane and offensive).

most of the spoken word either namechecks the guys I work with, or references some sort of private joke... like the whole aqualung thing (an inside joke that wouldn't make sense if I tried to explain it here...)

the title references two guys at work that are always “smoking the bowl” on the job – hence the nickname the Van Bowlski Brothers...

still plenty of great tracks and stuff in here – even without the knowledge of the inside jokes... hope you all like it.

many thanks to Vic and my man in the UK – Lewis!

enjoy!
