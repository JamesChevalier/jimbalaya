[King Megatrip][2] has released another mix! This one is called [Caveman On Campus][3], and it uses my edit ‘Bonham Grove'. The mix is straight up chaos and all over the map. It includes classic rock, hip hop, some punk rock and a whole bunch of bootleg mash-ups that he got from [GYBO][4]. Oh, and it's definitely not kid safe (I couldn't comment on its ‘Mother Approved' status).
